# About Me

I’m currently looking for my next challenge, so I suspect most viewers of this profile will be recruiters or potential employers; thus I've made a few of my recent applications public; I think each displays some facet about the kind of engineer and problem solver I am.

The apps on display here all use the Javascript tech stack, including Node.js, React.js, Express, and various other front-end and back-end frameworks and libraries.  I’m including apps that use both SQL and noSQL databases (I'm comfortable with both--my SQL experience is with mySQL and postgreSQL; noSQL is with MongoDB).  I deployed each of these apps using AWS EC2 (I also have experience with AWS EBS and Heroku for deployment), but two of the apps were built for my own edification (as opposed to public consumption) so they may not be live at the time of your viewing.  If an app is live, I'll be sure to include a link to the actual application in the README.  At a minimum, I'll include some GIFs of the app in action.

Before becoming an engineer, I spent a number of years in finance and marketing building things, solving problems, and collaborating with and leading teams.  These experiences give me a unique and valuable perspective when facing difficult challenges, making tough business decisions, and just generally operating in a team / corporate environment.

I’ve always been passionate about my work, but am especially energized by the software development process.  I love the way that a software application--when designed and implemented thoughtfully--can evolve and scale over time; for me, this makes even the simplest of applications important and exciting.  Thus, I’m really excited to join a team and start contributing meaningfully as soon as possible.
